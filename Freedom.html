          <p>Freedom Day is a public holiday in South Africa celebrated on 27 April.
            It celebrates freedom and commemorates the first post- apartheid elections held on that day in 1994.
            The 2020 Freedom Month is commemorated under the theme 'Valuing Our Freedom in Difficult Times'.
            The first democratic elections on 27 April 1994 gave birth to our constitutional democracy. For the majority of South Africans who had never voted before their dignity was restored and the country transformed to a non-racial, non-sexist and democratic society.
            Prior to this, during apartheid, racial segregation which was enforced by the National Party prevented any kind of inter-racial activity. South Africa is the country it is today because of their
            countless sacrifices and that of many other South Africans who fought tirelessly to overcome the brutal apartheid system.</p>

            <br> 
            <p> In my own words I would say that Freedom Day is a day of reaching a new height of belief that is common all over the world. In the United States of America there is a day that they collect the thoughts of reunionifing the nation by doing this. 
              How can a place that is called a country be called a country not celebrate a moment like this. So its universal. 
              I had to be freedom not only fairly but joining groups of other people to be closer to one another. It was just a different time that happen than. 
              South Africa had so much struggle as the nation know, but with the president Ceril Ramaphosa, join arms with teh files that 
              has everyone's information. it would be fair to say that everyone should know each other. 
              Please support the release and its constitutional debut of what it means to be a South African some parts of the world. 
              Thank You. </p>

                    <p>300 the number of years colonialism plagued South Africa. Colonialism also introduced politically enforced prejudice.
                    1948 Apartheid, an Afrikaans word meaning 'the state of being apart', was officially administered in South Africa. When the all-White National Party government took over the power reins that year, they wasted no time in enforcing the racial segregation policies already in place.
                    1994 South Africa's first-ever non-racial, democratic election took place — allowing all individuals over the age of 18 to cast their vote. Prior to 1994, voting was a privilege only extended to the country's White population.
                    27 the number of years South Africa has been 'defining' its fledgeling freedom.
                    19 political parties contested in the 1994 election. These were: African National Congress (ANC), National Party (NP), Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC), Freedom Front (FF), Democratic Party (DP), African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), Africa Muslim Party (AMP), African Moderates Congress (AMC), Dikwankwetla Party of South Africa (DPSA), Federal Party (FP), Minority Front (MF), Sport Organisation for Collective Contributions and Equal Rights (SOCCER), African Democratic Movement (ADM), Women's Right Peace Party (WRPP), Ximoko Progressive Party (XPP), Keep It Straight & Simple Party (KISS), Worker's List Party (WLP), and Luso-South Africa Party (LUSO).
                    19.7 million South Africans voted out of the 22.7 million eligible voters.</p>

                    <p> 19.7 million South Africans voted out of the 22.7 million eligible voters.
                      62.65% The percentage margin with which the African National Congress (ANC) — the ruling party — won the 1994 election. The National Party (NP), the official opposition, followed with 20.39 %; Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) with 10.54 %, Freedom Front (FF) with 2.2 %, Democratic Party (DP) with 1.7 %, Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) with 1.2 % and the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) with 0.5 %.
                      27 April 1994. South Africa's new flag, bearing six colours and signifying a nation headed towards unity, replaced the old Apartheid flag which had been used since 1928. The new flag was designed by the late Frederick Gordon Brownell, a South African vexillologist and genealogist.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>10 May 1994. The late Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as the first Black President of the country at an emotional ceremony held at The Union Buildings in Pretoria.
                        1995 The year when Freedom Day was first commemorated, a reminder of how far South Africa had come in its long fight against the brutal Apartheid regime!
                        10 December 1996. The final draft of South Africa's Constitution was signed into law by President Nelson Mandela in Sharpeville, a township located south of Gauteng. The Constitution, however, only came into effect on 4 February 1997.
                        11 The number of official languages equally recognised by the South African Constitution.
                        2 February 1990. The National Party government started the process of unbanning political parties and activists, as well as releasing political prisoners — the late Nelson Mandela being among them. The transition period between February 1990 and April 1994 was, sadly, characterised by political turmoil and gruesome murders between the ANC and IFP.</p>
